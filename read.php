					<p>Ration cards are an official document issued by state governments in India to households that are eligible to purchase subsidised food grain from the Public Distribution System under the National Food Security Act (NFSA). They also serve as a common form of identification for many Indians  . Our website is to provide the  Registration forms like customer’s , admins’s , products  which is easy to use. Ration card details can be performed in the app itself rather than going over to the shop ,stand in que and register the forms. Most of the ration shopkeepers keep fake ration cards with them. Due to availability of all ration items these items are present with the ration shop dealer so he can falsify the records and use the items to sell in the market loosely To overcome this problem.Primary Coperative system is implemented. This system is user friendly interactive and easy to  use, Time saving ,No complexity,Data security,and backup facility,Easy navigation through the data is provided,Formatted data ,and records information are easily approachable</p>
